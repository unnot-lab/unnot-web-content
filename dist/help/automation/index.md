# Automation (CLI & API)

You can run agents, list tools and executions, and check status from **scripts** or **other applications** using the **CLI** or the **REST API**. Both talk to the Unnot app over HTTP on the same port. The app must be running; there is no separate server process.

## What you need

- **Unnot app running** — start the application first. The API is served from inside the app.
- **Port** — default is **20222**. If that port is busy at startup, the app uses the next free port. Set or check the port in **Settings → General** (API port). The actual port in use may be written to `api-port.json` in the app data directory (e.g. in `userData` for the Electron app).
- **Remote access (optional)** — by default only **localhost** can connect. To call the API from another computer, enable **Settings → General → Allow remote API access** and restart. Traffic is unencrypted; use only on a trusted network or behind an HTTPS reverse proxy. See [Troubleshooting](/help/troubleshooting#cli-or-api-connection-refused-or-cannot-connect).

**Finding agent and tool IDs:** In the app you can use either the **exact name** or the **id**. To see the id: in **Agents** or **Tools**, open the table column menu (Columns button) and enable the **ID** column; or open an agent/tool in the editor, expand **Agent Info** or **Server Info**, then click **More** — the ID is listed there. You can also get ids from the API (e.g. `GET /api/v1/agents`, `GET /api/v1/tools`) or the CLI (`unnot list agents`, `unnot list tools`).

## CLI

The **CLI** is a command-line client: list agents and tools, run an agent, get execution result or logs, connect a tool, and more. Useful for scripts, scheduled tasks, and quick checks from the terminal.

The CLI ships **inside your Unnot installation** (the **`cli`** folder next to the application). Run **`unnot.cmd`** / **`unnot`** from that folder by full path, or add that folder to your PATH. It uses **`UNNOT_API_URL`** if set; otherwise it reads the port from **`api-port.json`** in the app data directory (`unnot`); otherwise **`http://localhost:20222`**.

See [CLI](/help/automation/cli) for where files are installed, PATH, commands, and examples.

## REST API

The **REST API** uses a path-based URL layout under `http://localhost:<port>/api/v1`: e.g. `GET /agents`, `POST /agent/{id}/run`, `GET /execution/{id}/result`. Use it from any HTTP client (curl, scripts, other apps). Same port and remote-access rules as above.

See [REST API](/help/automation/rest-api) for base URL, examples, and security notes.
